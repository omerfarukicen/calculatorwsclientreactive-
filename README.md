# AXIS2 Benchmark

Web Service Client Project.

This repository contains benchmarking tests for the AXIS2 framework, comparing its SYNC and ASYNC versions. The functions were tested using an end-to-end reactive approach. Detailed results can be found under the "Report" section in the "Resource" folder.

Additionally, response times were examined using Java Virtual Threads.

## Overview

The benchmarking tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the SYNC and ASYNC versions of AXIS2. By testing various functions in both modes, we aimed to understand their efficiency and suitability for different use cases.


### Metrics

Key metrics such as response times, throughput, and resource utilization were measured to evaluate the performance of AXIS2 SYNC and ASYNC versions effectively.

## Results

Detailed results of the benchmarking tests are provided in the "Report" section under the "Resource" folder. These results offer insights into the performance characteristics of both SYNC and ASYNC versions of AXIS2 across different scenarios.

## Future Work

In future iterations, we plan to explore additional performance metrics and conduct more extensive testing to further refine our understanding of AXIS2 SYNC and ASYNC versions.
